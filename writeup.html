            <h2>What Have You Done So Far?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    We have implemented a bubble chart that shows each
                    participant's average glucose level throughout the 10-day
                    study, categorized by diabetes status, color-coded by gut
                    health, and scaled for each participant's bubble by their
                    BMI value, including a tooltip for each participant’s dot.
                </li>
                <li>
                    We also implemented a scrolly-telling into this
                    visualization to show a time series throughout the 10 days
                    to show the variability of the different diabetes statuses
                    instead of a time slider and animation button.
                </li>
                <li>
                    We also added some annotations corresponding to some of the
                    days of the study which appear as the user scrolls through
                    the days, added more context to the webpage, and an
                    additional context/transition paragraph to the next
                    visualization.
                </li>
                <li>
                    We started to create a template for the second half/the rest
                    of our project that’s still left to fill in completely. The
                    template includes an
                    introduction/landing page to first give a brief overview of
                    the dataset/study before scrolling, which is the start of our next visualization.
                    We plan to complete this as we progress through the project.

        <!-- Most Challenging Part of the Project -->

            <h2>
                What Will Be the Most Challenging Part of Your Project to Design
                and Why?
            </h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    One of our main challenges for our second visualization is
                    how to effectively communicate/visualize how macros affect
                    glucose levels and spikes in different diabetic categories
                    in a way that’s interesting/fun for the user.
                </li>
                <li>
                    We can’t decide how to derive the best insights to display
                    to the user as we’re scrolling through.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Based on our datasets and exploratory data analysis, we’re
                    still trying to figure out how to group the participants in
                    new ways and also describe things such as food macros
                    without making the visuals cluttered or unintuitive.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In a more application sense, coding the scrollytelling and
                    animations of our visualizations data and the
                    incoming/disappearing text will be hard to incorporate into
                    our HTML page. This will be hard since we haven’t had a lot
                    of practice, besides Lab 8, with d3’s scrolly() and we’re
                    trying to create an impressive final project.
